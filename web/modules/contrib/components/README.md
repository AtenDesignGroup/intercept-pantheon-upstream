# Components!

The Components module makes it easier for a theme to organize its components.
It allows themes (and modules) to register Twig namespaces and provides some 
additional Twig functions and filters for use in Drupal templates.

For a full description of the module, visit the
[project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/components).
