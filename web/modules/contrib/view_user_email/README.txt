View User Email

The View User Email module is a very simple module which allows site administrators to grant access to certain roles to see other users email field. If this functionality is added into the Drupal core this module will be deprecated.

You need this module only if you want to allow the default email field to be seen by certain roles. It has security implications though.

How to use:
1. Install the module. (How-to install a module)
2. Go to /admin/people/permissions and search for the Access other users email field permission
3. Assign the permission to the desired roles and enjoy.
